# Issue Resolved: iOS Bundling Error Fixed ✅

## 🚨 Problem Identified
**Error**: `Unable to resolve "expo-linking" from "src/services/EmergencyService.js"`

The bundling was failing because the `EmergencyService.js` file was importing `expo-linking` but this dependency was not installed in the project.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Installed Missing Dependency**
```bash
npm install expo-linking
```

### 2. **Updated Package Versions**
```bash
npx expo install --fix
```
This updated the following packages to be compatible with Expo SDK 53:
- `expo-location@18.0.10` → `~18.1.5`
- `react-native-maps@1.18.0` → `1.20.1`
- `react-native-safe-area-context@5.4.1` → `5.4.0`
- `react-native-screens@4.11.0` → `~4.10.0`

### 3. **Verified Resolution**
- Metro bundler now starts successfully
- No more import resolution errors
- App is ready for development and testing
