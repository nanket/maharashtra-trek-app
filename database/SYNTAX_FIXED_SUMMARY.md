**Solution**: Regenerated the migration with proper SQL syntax.

## ✅ Ready to Run - ALL 32 Entries

Your complete migration is now ready with **perfect SQL syntax**:

### Step 1: Reset Database
```sql

database/fresh_start.sql
```

### Step 2: Load ALL 32 Entries (FIXED)
```sql
-- Copy and run this FIXED file in Supabase SQL Editor:
database/complete_data_migration.sql
```

## ✅ What's Fixed:
- **SQL Syntax**: Proper INSERT statement structure
- **ON CONFLICT**: Correctly positioned conflict resolution
